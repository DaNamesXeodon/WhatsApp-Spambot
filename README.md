This is a WhatsApp spambot coded in Python By Xeodon using the pyKey module by gauthsvenkat and pyautogui by asweigart.
Change the whatPath variable in main.py to the path in which your WhatsApp executable is stored. You will have to gain acess to this executable.

This will hurt.

Note that emojis, in group names or messages, are not currently supported.
